# Solutions to the classical harmonic oscillator

## i. Overview

In this module we define the solutions to the classical harmonic oscillator,
prove that they satisfy the equation of motion, and prove some properties of the solutions.

## ii. Key results

- `InitialConditions` is a structure for the initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator.
- `trajectories` is the trajectories to the harmonic oscillator for given initial conditions.
- `trajectories_equationOfMotion` proves that the solution satisfies the equation of motion.

## A. The initial conditions

We define the type of initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator.
The initial conditions are currently defined as an initial position and an initial velocity,
that is the values of the solution and its time derivative at time `0`.

-/
/-!

### A.1. Definition of the initial conditions

We start by defining the type of initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator.

-/

/-- The initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator specified by an initial position,
  and an initial velocity. -/
structure InitialConditions where
  /-- The initial position of the harmonic oscillator. -/
  x₀ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)
  /-- The initial velocity of the harmonic oscillator. -/
  v₀ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)

/-!

#### A.1.1. Extensionality lemma

We prove an extensionality lemma for `InitialConditions`.
That is, a lemma which states that two initial conditions are equal if their
initial positions and initial velocities are equal.

### A.2. Relation to other types of initial conditions

We relate the initial condition given by an initial position and an initial velocity
to other specifications of initial conditions.

In this section, we implement alternative ways to specify initial conditions for the harmonic
oscillator. The standard `InitialConditions` type specifies position and velocity at time `t=0`,
but in practice it is often useful to specify initial conditions at other times or in other forms.

Currently implemented:
- **Initial conditions at arbitrary time**: Specify position and velocity at any time `t₀`,
  not necessarily at `t=0`.
  This is useful for problems where the natural reference time is not zero.

Future work (to be added in separate PRs) :
- Initial conditions from two positions at different times
- Initial conditions from two velocities at different times
- Amplitude-phase parametrization

All alternative forms can be converted to the standard `InitialConditions` type via conversion
functions, and we prove that the converted initial conditions produce trajectories that satisfy
the original specifications.

-/

/-!

#### A.2.1. Initial conditions at arbitrary time

We define a type for initial conditions specified at an arbitrary time `t₀`, rather than at `t=0`.
This is useful when the natural reference point for a problem is not at time zero.

-/

/-- Initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator specified at an arbitrary time `t₀`.

  This structure allows specifying the position and velocity at any time `t₀`, not necessarily
  at `t=0`. This is useful for problems where the natural reference time is not zero.

  The conditions can be converted to the standard `InitialConditions` format (at `t=0`)
  using the `toInitialConditions` function. -/

  t₀ : Time
  /-- The position at time t₀. -/
  x_t₀ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)
  /-- The velocity at time t₀. -/
  v_t₀ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)

##### A.2.1.1. Extensionality lemma

We prove an extensionality lemma for `InitialConditionsAtTime`.

    IC₁ = IC₂ := by
  cases IC₁
  cases IC₂
  simp_all

/-!

##### A.2.1.2. Conversion to standard initial conditions

We now define the conversion from `InitialConditionsAtTime` to the standard `InitialConditions`.

The conversion works by "running the trajectory backward in time" from `t₀` to `0`.
Given that we know `x(t₀)` and `v(t₀)`, we use the harmonic oscillator solution formula
with time-reversal to determine what `x(0)` and `v(0)` must have been.

Mathematically, if `x(t) = cos(ωt)·x₀ + (sin(ωt)/ω)·v₀`, then setting `t = t₀`:
  `x(t₀) = cos(ωt₀)·x₀ + (sin(ωt₀)/ω)·v₀`
  `v(t₀) = -ω·sin(ωt₀)·x₀ + cos(ωt₀)·v₀`

Solving this linear system for `x₀` and `v₀` gives the formulas below.

-/

namespace InitialConditionsAtTime

/-- Convert initial conditions at time `t₀` to standard initial conditions at `t=0`.

  This conversion uses the harmonic oscillator solution formula with time-reversal.
  The resulting `InitialConditions` will produce a trajectory that passes through
  `x_t₀` with velocity `v_t₀` at time `t₀`.

  See `toInitialConditions_trajectory_at_t₀` and `toInitialConditions_velocity_at_t₀` for
  the correctness proofs. -/
noncomputable def toInitialConditions (S : HarmonicOscillator)
    (IC : InitialConditionsAtTime) : InitialConditions where
  x₀ := cos (S.ω * IC.t₀) • IC.x_t₀ - (sin (S.ω * IC.t₀) / S.ω) • IC.v_t₀
  v₀ := S.ω • sin (S.ω * IC.t₀) • IC.x_t₀ + cos (S.ω * IC.t₀) • IC.v_t₀

/-!
The correctness proofs showing that the conversion produces the expected trajectory
are given later in section D.1, after the trajectory machinery has been defined.
-/

TODO "6VZME" "Implement other initial conditions (deferred to future PRs). For example:
- Two positions at different times.
- Two velocities at different times.
And convert them into the type `InitialConditions` above."

### A.3. The zero initial conditions

The zero initial conditions are the initial conditions with zero initial position
and zero initial velocity.

In the end, we will see that this corresponds to the solution which is identically zero,
i.e. the particle remains at rest at the origin.

## B. Trajectories associated with the initial conditions

To each initial condition we association a trajectory. We will prove some basic properties
of these trajectories.

Eventually we will show that these trajectories satisfy the equation of motion, for
now we can think of them as some choice of trajectory associated with the initial conditions.

the condition that
